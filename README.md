# camRa

The SD Card Processing App/camRa package is a point-and-click software program developed by Idaho Fish and Game (IDFG) that allows anyone to process camera trap SD cards, following a standard protocol, as soon as cameras are pulled from the field. The app has a similar look and feel to the more familiar IPM/popR apps. Designed primarily to be used on one camera SD card at a time, the SD Card Processing App provides the tools to select a project and camera, copy photos to a back-up drive, read and edit the camera’s metadata when errors are detected, and rename the photos to a standard naming convention.

To run the app, you’ll need three free, external software programs:  
  1. R (version 4.2.4 or higher, https://cran.r-project.org/). 
  2. RStudio (free desktop version 2023.03.0+386 or higher, https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download ).  
  3. Strawberry Perl (version 5.32.1.1 or higher http://strawberryperl.com/ ).
